## Module 2

This HW deals primarily with loops and functions.  It will introduce you to some interesting number theory as well.
You have probably heard of prime numbers and composite numbers before, but have you ever heard of abundant numbers, or
narcissistic numbers?  This assignment will ask you to write code to identify different kinds of number properties.

We also want you to learn how to reuse code in this assignment, by writing and using functions.  This is a basic
strategy for reducing complexity in a program.  Why?  Because things change, and if you have the same thing in several
places, when you change one, you have to change all the others.  And you can’t always find them all!  In order to reuse
code, you must take common pieces of code and put them into functions.  Failure to do so will result in loss of points.

We also want you to add comments to your code and docstrings to your functions.

**You can assume that all inputs in this assignment will be positive integers.**

Each function has been defined for you, but without the code. See the docstring in each function (in the starter code)
for more details on what the function is supposed to do and how to write the code. It should be clear enough. In some
cases, we have provided hints and examples to get you started.
